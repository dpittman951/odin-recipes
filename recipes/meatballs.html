        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>After trying air fryer meatballs, I will 
            never bake them in the oven again. The insides 
            stay nice and tender while the outsides get a 
            slight crisp on them. The best part is that you 
            can make them ahead of time and freeze for 
            later use. I have included those directions in 
            the notes. Dip meatballs in marinara, if desired.</p>
